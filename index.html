<h4>HI! I’M MICHELA ( > ^ < ) A … WEIRD PERSON.
<h4>
<p>Nice to meet you!
</p>

<p>I am a 16 year old girl who lives in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>I go to Excelsior Preparatory High School in Queens which is pretty far away from where I live.
</p>

My favourite websites are <a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube!</a> and <a href="https://www.viki.com">Viki!</a>

<p>I am a senior as of September 2019 and I am planning to go to college.
</p>

<p>Colleges I consider:
Binghamton University: I really enjoyed visiting this college because liked the environment
and was lucky enough to visit twice.</p>

<p>Temple University: This was such an interesting school, the had food trucks at every corner… and who doesn’t like food.
</p>

<p>As of right now I’m in the Girls Who Code summer immersion program that teaches girls about CS
 and also encourage them to find a career in CS while teaching them about sisterhood and helping each other.
</p>

<p>I consider myself a very open minded person and I accept other people’s ideas and I am interested in experiencing new things.
  </p>
<p>I enjoy all genres of music as long as it keeps me interested or entertain and
I am really into K-music I enjoy korean and I am also learning the language through apps and also dramas.
